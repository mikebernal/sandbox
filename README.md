This is my playground repository where I test and learn data structures and algorithm.

#### Table of Content

1. Tail Call
2. ES6 Set data structure


### Tail Call

Tail call calls and returns another function inside a parent function. This subroutine optimize memory as the recursion won't grow the stack.

### ES6 Set data structure

Set data structure stores only unique values in a container. This is useful if you want to get only a unique attributes from a collection like an array of objects from an API response. It uses the value as a key.
